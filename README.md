# build-kismetdursun

Personal WordPress build environment for **Kismet Dursun**.

This repository powers a live portfolio site and serves as a working sandbox for block-theme development, custom patterns, lightweight plugins, and AI-assisted workflows.

It is an active system, not a demo or starter template.

---

## What This Repo Is

- A production WordPress site used as a portfolio and experimentation space
- A place to build and refine:
  - Block patterns
  - Theme tokens
  - Small, purpose-built plugins
- A record of how real projects are designed, built, and iterated

---

## Stack (Current)

- WordPress (block theme: Twenty Twenty-Four)
- Custom patterns (file-based)
- Custom plugin(s) as needed
- Local development via LocalWP
- Git + GitHub for version control
- AI-assisted development (used for planning, review, and implementation support)

---

## Notes

- The codebase is intentionally minimal and evolving
- Patterns and templates are treated as first-class building blocks
- File-based sources are preferred over database-synced artifacts
- Documentation is updated only when it reflects the current state of the system

---

## Local Development

cd ~/Local\ Sites/build-kismetdursun/app/public
